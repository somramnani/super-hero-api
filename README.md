A simple React app that allows users to search for their favorite superheroes. It retrieves data from the [SuperHero API](https://superheroapi.com) by routing requests through a custom [Express Proxy Server](https://github.com/somramnani/api-proxy-server) to handle CORS restrictions. Results are displayed using responsive card components styled with Material UI.
